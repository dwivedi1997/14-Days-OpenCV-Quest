## Day 2
Building a document scanner in OpenCV boils down to three simple steps — and it’s going to take you just a few minutes.

All we have to do is:<br>
Detect edges<br>
Use the edges in the image to find the contour (outline) representing the piece of paper being scanned<br>
Apply a perspective transform to obtain the top-down view of the document.
