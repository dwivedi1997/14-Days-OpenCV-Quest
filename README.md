# 14-Days-OpenCV-Quest
This course organizes those tutorials into a cohesive program designed to get you working in computer vision and deep learning FAST.  You’ll learn a lot over the next 2.5 weeks, and you’re also going to get your hands dirty, digging into the code and building real computer vision projects. The thing is, computer vision and deep learning are a lot of fun — when you approach them the right way.  In other words, this course is not about hours of monotonous study or doing boring, tedious homework. It’s about getting hands-on with CV and DL and using them to solve real-world problems. You get a practical education and you get to have fun along the way.
